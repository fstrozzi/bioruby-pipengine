# Summary

This is an ultra simple YAML-based pipeline execution engine. The tool allows defining a pipeline template in YAML, specifing command lines, resources and software to be used along with pipeline steps dependencies. The pipeline can then be applied over a single sample or multiple samples, generating actual runnable bash scripts which can then be sumitted automatically to a scheduling system or runned locally. 

The bash scripts generated by Pipengine includes error controls and logging for each step, plus the automatical generation of directories based on sample and pipeline steps name, and the moving of input and output data across original and temporary folders if needed. 

These approach allows the user to avoid rewrite boiler plate code to perform all these accessory tasks. Moreover Pipengine produces a stable and reproducible working and output tree for which analysis, which transparently stores all the results of each step of the pipeline for each sample analysed. In this way pipeline intermediate or final results can be predictably parsed and accessed by the analysts with other tools and utility. 

The software was developed in 2012, so a pre-CWL/WDL era, but has been used across several research groups and core facilities for years. It directly support PBS/Torque scheduler but the tool can be easily adapted to work with other schedulers if needed. 

Pipengine is written in Ruby and is available as a BioRuby gem.
